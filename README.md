# Mini Game 2024
This is the 2024 mini game project, done by the Game Developers' Group @ IUI.

## Mission-Critical Tasks

* **Craft Candy (in Pentagram)**: Once ingredients are placed in the pentagram, and the player presses X, the game should craft the candy that corresponds to the pattern the player created on the pentagram. The candy should appear in the center of the pentagram, in the bowl.
  * Match Recipe & Craft the Candy (Place in Bowl)
* **Recipe Book**: The user needs to know what the recipes are for the candies. The user will walk up to the recipe book & interact with it. This will display the book on the screen, which the user can flip through to see the current recipes.
* **Twins:** Twins need to trigger the lose condition for the player. They also need to be able to interact with the candy in the bowl.
  * Twin Insta-Kill (end game)
  * Twin-Candy Bowl Interaction
* **Lose Screen**: Once the twins trigger the end of the game, we need to display a lose screen for the player to either re-start or quit the game.
  * On Twin Insta-Kill, display play-again & quit buttons
  * display the amount of time the player lasted / # of candies consumed?
* **Save Best Time/Best Candy Count**: We need to store the player's best run - which is either the best time or the # of candies (or both, although they are correlated.).
* **Start of Game**: The game has a start screen, but no instructions on how to play. We need either a tutorial or some sort of instructions for the player.
